# Lead List Filtering Guide

This guide explains how to use the query builder fields API to filter leads in the Adhub App n8n node.

## Overview

The lead list API supports advanced filtering using a query builder approach. You can filter leads by system fields (status, source, created*at, etc.) and custom fields (cf*\*).

## Filter Payload Structure

The filter payload follows this structure:

```json
{
  "mode": "AND" | "OR",
  "rules": [
    {
      "field": "lead.status",
      "operator": "Equals To",
      "value": "New"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Available Filter Fields

## Using Filters in n8n Node

### Method 1: Form Mode (Recommended)

When using the n8n node with `Body Type` set to `Form`:

1. **Set Filter Mode**: Choose between `And` (all rules must match) or `Or` (any rule can match)

2. **Add Filter Rules**: Use the `Filter Rules` collection to add multiple rules:
   - **Field**: Enter the field key (e.g., `lead.status`, `cf_company`)
   - **Operator**: Enter one of the allowed operators for that field (e.g., `Equals To`, `Contains`)
   - **Value**: Enter the value to filter by (for select fields, use the option value like `New`, `Website`)

### Example 1: Filter by Status

To get all leads with status "New":

```
Filter Mode: And
Filter Rules:
  - Field: lead.status
  - Operator: Equals To
  - Value: New
```

### Example 2: Filter by Multiple Conditions

To get leads with status "New" AND source "Website":

```
Filter Mode: And
Filter Rules:
  - Field: lead.status
  - Operator: Equals To
  - Value: New
  - Field: lead.source
  - Operator: Equals To
  - Value: Website
```

### Example 3: Filter with OR Logic

To get leads with status "New" OR status "Contacted":

```
Filter Mode: Or
Filter Rules:
  - Field: lead.status
  - Operator: Equals To
  - Value: New
  - Field: lead.status
  - Operator: Equals To
  - Value: Contacted
```

### Example 4: Filter by Custom Field

To get leads where company contains "Tech":

```
Filter Mode: And
Filter Rules:
  - Field: cf_company
  - Operator: Contains
  - Value: Tech
```

### Example 5: Filter by Date

To get leads created today:

```
Filter Mode: And
Filter Rules:
  - Field: lead.created_at
  - Operator: Today
  - Value: (leave empty for date operators like Today, Yesterday, etc.)
```

### Example 6: Filter by Date Range

To get leads created between two dates:

```
Filter Mode: And
Filter Rules:
  - Field: lead.created_at
  - Operator: Between
  - Value: 2026-01-01,2026-03-31
```

### Example 7: Check Empty Fields

To get leads without an email:

```
Filter Mode: And
Filter Rules:
  - Field: lead.email
  - Operator: Is Empty
  - Value: (leave empty)
```

### Example 8: Complex Filter

To get leads that are:

- Status is "New" OR "Contacted"
- AND source is "Website"
- AND company is not empty

```
Filter Mode: And
Filter Rules:
  - Field: lead.status
  - Operator: Equals To
  - Value: New
  - Field: lead.status
  - Operator: Equals To
  - Value: Contacted
  - Field: lead.source
  - Operator: Equals To
  - Value: Website
  - Field: cf_company
  - Operator: Is Not Empty
  - Value: (leave empty)
```

Note: For complex OR conditions within AND, you may need to use JSON mode.

### Method 2: JSON Mode

When using the n8n node with `Body Type` set to `JSON`, you can provide the complete filter payload directly:

```json
{
	"per_page": 50,
	"page": 1,
	"search": "john",
	"filter": {
		"mode": "AND",
		"rules": [
			{
				"field": "lead.status",
				"operator": "Equals To",
				"value": "New"
			},
			{
				"field": "lead.source",
				"operator": "Equals To",
				"value": "Website"
			},
			{
				"field": "cf_company",
				"operator": "Contains",
				"value": "Tech"
			}
		]
	},
	"sort_by": "name",
	"sort_dir": "asc"
}
```

## Getting Available Fields Dynamically

You can use the `List Query Fields` operation to fetch all available filter fields and their options:

1. Set Resource: `Lead`
2. Set Operation: `List Query Fields`
3. Set Context: `Lead List`

This will return all available fields with their types, operators, and options (for select fields).

## Important Notes

1. **Field Keys**: Always use the exact field key (e.g., `lead.status`, not `status`)
2. **Operator Names**: Use the exact operator name as returned by the query fields API
3. **Select Field Values**: For select fields, use the `value` from the options array (e.g., `New`, not `New Lead`)
4. **Date Operators**: Operators like `Today`, `Yesterday`, `This Week` don't require a value
5. **Empty Checks**: Use `Is Empty` or `Is Not Empty` operators without a value
6. **Multiple Rules**: You can add as many filter rules as needed
7. **Filter Mode**: Choose `And` for all rules to match, `Or` for any rule to match

## Troubleshooting

### Filter not working?

- Verify the field key is correct (use List Query Fields to check)
- Ensure the operator is valid for that field type
- For select fields, use the exact option value
- Check that the filter mode (AND/OR) is appropriate for your use case

### Getting empty results?

- Try removing filters one by one to identify the issue
- Use the List Query Fields operation to verify available options
- Check if the value format matches the field type (date format, etc.)

### Need complex OR logic?

- Use JSON mode for complex nested conditions
- Consider using multiple API calls with different filters if needed
